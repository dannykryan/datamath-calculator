This calculator was created as part of [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com) full-stack javascript course.
It uses vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript and the design is based on the first retail calculator, the [Texas Instruments TI-2500 Datamath](http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/texas_instruments_2500.html#TI2500-1) - just because i thought the Datamath had a really cool, retro design!
